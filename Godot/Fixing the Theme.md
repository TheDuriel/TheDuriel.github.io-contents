Godots new 4.6 "minimal" theme is bad.

1. It has less contrast between elements.
2. It increases padding around UI elements.
3. It compresses lists to counteract the increased padding.
4. It frequently fails to distinguish interactive and static elements.
5. It uses grey instead of blue as a base color. This is actually an improvement.

So anyways. If you are using 4.6 you can still change back to the original theme:

**Go to Editor > Editor Settings > Interface > Theme and select 'Classic'**

Then you can apply my own personal touches for a classic "grey" look. (Adobe etc.)

1. Base Color = `#333333`= <span style="background:#333333">Example</span>
2. My Accent Color = `#991f1f` = <font color="#991f1f">Example</font> Surprisingly Neutral
3. Icon Saturation = 0.8
4. Relationship Line Opacity = 0.3
5. Corner Radius = 0
6. Border Size = 3

Feel free to experiment with the accent color to find something that is sufficiently neutral for your use case.

I also use a custom font for the editor and script editor.
