I have been developing Tabletop RPG content and games for about 10 years. Here's a sampling of projects which may be of interest. Note that most of these are unfinished, usually having been abandoned at the "good enough to play with my friends" stage, before moving to actual product design.

### Ikrand - Original
The original Ikrand was designed as an Eclipse Phase total conversion. Taking the dice system and character creation rules. But completely retooling it for a fantasy setting. It begun somewhat simulationistic in the D&D style, but adapted a more OSR/ADnD mindset.

The original Ikrand is no longer in development, and I consider it finished at this point. IIRC, there were some small things about the magic systems that still needed polishing. But that's about it.

### Ikrand - Classic
A ground up rewrite of the Original. This game focuses solely on the OSR style experience, building on top of a fundamentally new ruleset that is tailored in large parts for the Ikrand Setting. With some overarching Fiction First style influences.

This game is still in active development.

### Out of the Dark - Formerly Ikrand Stories
Out of the Dark is a fully Fiction First game in style of Powered by the Apocalypses, FATE, and Blades in the Dark. It focuses mainly on being a tool set and explanation of the Fiction First philosophy.

This game is still in active development. But there's nothing to show for it yet.

### Game of Darkness
A total conversion hack for Blades in the Dark, reflavoring the game for a politically charged fantasy adventuring style.

Game of Darkness requires a general grasp of Blades in the Dark, and only contains changes from the base game, it can not be played without the BITD rulebook.

This game is not being developed, and is considered "finished" for a hack.

## Experiments
Things that were tried once, maybe, but never saw the light of day. Including several prototypes of Ikrand Stories, microgames, and shit.

### Nosgoth
A Pathfinder 1E campaign draft for playing in the Legacy of Kain universe. It was never played, and is overall just kinda shit.

### SWN BoardGame
A conversion of the Stars Without Number original 'faction turn' into an almost Civilization style board gaming experience. It was used extensively to create the Ikrand setting.

### War on Time
A draft for a Blades in the Dark hack focusing on "time spy" fiction in a post world war 3 earth, where time travel continues to ravage the planet. This was drafted as a bit of a lark, and is extremely politically tone deaf.
